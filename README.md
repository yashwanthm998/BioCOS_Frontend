# Frontend-Project

During our internship, we worked on the frontend development of a company’s website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal was to create a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing website that accurately reflects the company’s brand and services. We successfully delivered a professional and functional website that meets the company’s needs. Our teamwork and skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resulted in a high-quality product that improves the company’s online presence and user engagement.
